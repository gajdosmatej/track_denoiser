# track_denoiser

The file trace_bkgnd_gen.py contains methods for generating and visualising tracks of noise and the signal in 3D space â€“ the details are described in the file. 

There are several important classes used for plotting, NN model training, IO and estimating model quality in file denoise_traces.py. It is meant to be imported and used in the main script file, which is not included in this repository, because it is changing all the time.

One can find a few images stored in the imgs/ directory. 3D_track_example contains a 3D view on the tracks generated by trace_bkgnd_gen.py. 
Projections of these tracks into the main coordinate planes are stored in projections_example_{n}.png.

The directory models/ contains models which have been already trained, along with histograms of noise supression and signal reconstruction, schemes of model architecture, various data, plot of training history and several example pictures of the denoising process. Most of these files are created by the script postcluster.py.

There are NN training scripts ready to be used on MetaCentrum cluster in the cluster/ directory.

The scripts are small and often changing, so I have not implemented any user-friendly interfaces for them yet - that might change in the future :).
