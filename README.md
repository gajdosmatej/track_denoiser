# track_denoiser

The file trace_bkgnd_gen.py contains methods for generating and visualising tracks of noise and the signal in 3D space – the details are described in the file. 
The script denoise_traces.py takes the saved data from trace_bkgnd_gen.py, trains convolutional neural network denoiser on them, 
saves the model into model_denoise directory and finally shows several images of the denoising process.

There are a few images stored in the imgs directory. 3D_track_example contains a 3D view on the tracks generated by trace_bkgnd_gen.py. 
Projections of these tracks into the main coordinate planes are stored in projections_example_{n}.png. Lastly, each of denoise_attempt_{n}.png contains three subplots – 
the upper one is only the projection of the signal, the middle one is signal+noise and the bottom one is signal without noise reconstructed by the neural model.

The scripts are small and often changing, so I have not implemented any user-friendly interfaces for them yet - that might change in the future :).
